# Assignment

This sample app downloads two csv datafeeds from two links, sorts the data and generates two new csv files according to some predefined company standard, at the end the newly created csv files are uploaded to a ftp server. The app is written in JavaScript and Node.js

# Comments

This application works as expected except for the download part. I had difficulties to sort the callback problem at first and since I did not have any time to rewrite the piece of code. As a first attempt in Node.js I would say that I am rather satisfied with the results.

# TODO

1. Finish the download part
2. Develop test suit.
3. Refactor, refactor, refactor ...
